### Install, Build and Run Tests

## Install

```
Download the github repo and then run:

npm install
npm run build

See all commands at:

npm run cli --help

```

### Quick Start - Command Line (CLI)

First install packages and build, then follow the steps here to create your first Atomical and query the status. Use `yarn cli`to get a list of all commands available.

#### 0. Environment File (.env)

The environment file comes with defaults (`.env.example`), but it is highly recommend to install and operate your own ElectrumX server. Web browser communication is possible through the `wss` (secure websockets) interface of ElectrumX.

```
ELECTRUMX_WSS=wss://electrumx.atomicals.xyz:50012

// Optional (defaults to wallet.json)
WALLET_PATH=path-to-wallet.json
```

_ELECTRUMX_WSS_: URL of the ElectrumX with Atomicals support. Note that only `wss` endpoints are accessible from web browsers.

#### 1. Wallet Setup

The purpose of the wallet is to create p2tr (pay-to-taproot) spend scripts and to receive change from the transactions made for the various operations. _Do not put more funds than you can afford to lose, as this is still beta!_ 


To initialize a new `wallet.json` file that will store your address for receiving change use the `wallet-init` command. Alternatively, you may populate the `wallet.json` manually, ensuring that the address at `m/44'/0'/0'/0/0` is equal to the address and the derivePath is set correctly.

Configure the path in the environment `.env` file to point to your wallet file. defaults to `./wallet.json`

Default:
```
WALLET_PATH=.
WALLET_FILE=wallet.json
```
Update to `wallets/` directory:

```
WALLET_PATH=./wallets
WALLET_FILE=wallet.json
```

Create the wallet:

```
yarn cli wallet-init

>>>

Wallet created at wallet.json
phrase: maple maple maple maple maple maple maple maple maple maple maple maple
Legacy address (for change): 1FXL2CJ9nAC...u3e9Evdsa2pKrPhkag
Derive Path: m/44'/0'/0'/0/0
WIF: L5Sa65gNR6QsBjqK.....r6o4YzcqNRnJ1p4a6GPxqQQ
